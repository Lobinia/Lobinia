Hi there üê±‚Äçüíª, I'm Maya! 
I'm a 23-year-old front-end developer (for now, since I am learning BackEnd skills too) from the Brazil. The languages I use most are JavaScript, recently I am learning NodeJS as a stack upgrade and looking forward to learn ReactJS.

I am currently looking for my first job in the area as a Junior Developer, to make coding more than just a hobby. But also my livelihood.

You will find in this Github: Some exercises, website templates and projects of mine.

History: I did a computer technician course integrated with my high school and that was my first touch with developing at the age of 13, all the way to 16. Then I left the developing area because I was naive and my teachers didn't encouraged me to stay in the dev area, and I went to law school, only to find that I cannot fit in the scenario the way it is. Then at the age of 22 I took the courage to came out as a transgender girl, and got back to coding sure that this is what I want to do, and I've progressed more than I could ever imagine in just a year of constant practicing.
