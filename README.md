### History
I did a computer technician course integrated with my high school and that was my first touch with developing at the age of 13, all the way to 16. Then I left the developing area because I was naive and my teachers didn't encouraged me to stay in the dev area, and I went to law school, only to find that I cannot fit in the scenario the way it is. Then at the age of 22 I got back to coding sure that this is what I want to do, and I've progressed more than I could ever imagine in just two years of constant practicing.
